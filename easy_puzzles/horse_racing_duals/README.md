## The Goal

Casablanca's hippodrome is organizing a new type of horse racing: duals. During a dual, only two horses will participate in the race. In order for the race to be interesting, it is necessary to try and select two horses with similar strength.

Write a program which, using a given number of strengths, identifies the two closes strengths and shows their difference with an integer (≥ 0).

## Game Input

### Input

Line 1: number `n` of horses.

The `n` following lines: the strength `pᵢ` of each horse. `pᵢ` is an integer.

### Output

The difference `d` between the two closest strengths. `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
